# Activ8 Fitness App

This is a web application that was designed and developed by 3 Front End Engineering Students of [The Iron Yard Orlando](http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/) as a final project over the last 2 weeks of the 12 week program. 

The project was built initially using AngularJS, HTML5, and CSS3, along with several tools like Bootstrap, Yeoman, GulpJS, and others. 

After The Iron Yard, one of those students, [Logan Arnett](https://loganarnett.com) has continued to add on to the idea and rebuild the web application using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to become a native mobile application as well. This is where you will find the updates on that project and the application itself.
